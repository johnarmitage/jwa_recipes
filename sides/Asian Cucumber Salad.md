## INGREDIENTS
- 1 large English cucumber sliced* about 4 cups
- ½ cup rice vinegar
- 2 tsp sesame oil
- 1 Tbsp liquid aminos soy sauce, or coconut aminos
- 1 small clove garlic minced

## RECIPE
1. Stir together the rice vinegar, sesame oil, liquid aminos (or soy sauce or coconut aminos), garlic and pure maple syrup in a mixing bowl.
2. Run a vegetable peeler down the side of the cucumber in 3 or 4 strips and slice the cucumber thinly.
