## INGREDIENTS
### BEEF TENDERLOIN ROAST
  - 1 center-cut beef tenderloin roast (4 to 4 ½ pounds), trimmed and tied
  - 2 teaspoons kosher salt
  - 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
  - 2 tablespoons avocado oil

### GARLIC HERB BUTTER
  - 6 tablespoons softened butter
  - 6 garlic cloves, minced
  - 1 teaspoon finely chopped fresh rosemary leaves
  - 1 teaspoon finely chopped fresh thyme leaves

## INSTRUCTIONS
  1. Remove the beef tenderloin from the fridge and let it come to room temperature prior to cooking, about 1 to 2 hours.
  2. In a small bowl, mix together the butter, garlic, rosemary, and thyme. Set aside.
  3. Preheat the oven to 425°F (220°C). Slice the beef tenderloin in half, then trim and tie it up (if it hasn't already been done by the butcher).
  4. Use paper towels to pat any excess moisture from the beef tenderloin, then season both sides with salt and pepper.
  5. Heat the oil in a large cast-iron pan over medium-high heat. Once the oil is shimmering, add the beef tenderloin and brown for a few minutes on all sides, about 10 minutes total, to create a golden brown crust.
  6. Slather the butter herb mixture over the top side of the beef tenderloin, then transfer the entire pan to the oven. If using a probe thermometer, insert the probe before placing the tenderloin in the oven. Roast the beef tenderloin for 15-20 minutes, depending on how you like your meat cooked (see temperature tips above).
  7. Remove the beef tenderloin from the oven and transfer to a cutting board. Let it rest for 10 to 15 minutes, to allow the juices to redistribute. Then remove the twine and slice into 1-inch thick pieces. If you'd like, serve with horseradish sauce.
