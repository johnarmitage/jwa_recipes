## Ingredients

  - 1 red bell pepper, diced
  - 1/2 onion, diced
  - 2 cloves garlic, minced
  - 1/4 cup cherry tomatoes, quartered
  - 1/4 pound lean ground turkey
  - 1 teaspoon cumin
  - 1 teaspoon chili powder
  - 1 teaspoon paprika
  - 3/4 teaspoon oregano
  - 1/2 cup cooked brown rice (I used the quick cooking brown rice to make everything faster)
  - 2 teaspoons olive oil
  - 1/4 cup shredded cheddar cheese
  - 1 teaspoon fresh lime juice
  - Chopped cilantro for garnish!

## Instructions

1. Add 1 teaspoon of your olive oil in a large skillet over medium high heat
2. When the pan is hot, add your ground turkey and season with salt and pepper
3. Let the turkey brown in the pan, stirring occasionally until it is cooked through
4. Meanwhile, cook your brown rice
5. When your turkey is almost done, add 1/2 teaspoon cumin, 1/2 teaspoon chili powder, 1/2 teaspoon paprika, and 1/4 teaspoon oregano. Stir to combine
6. Set the turkey aside on a plate and add the remaining 1 teaspoon of olive oil to your pan
7. Add your veggies (pepper, onion, garlic) and season with salt and pepper. Add your cherry tomatoes in with the veggies after they have been cooking for a few minutes – stir to combine
8. Let the veggies cook until they have softened. If it gets too dry, add a splash of water and stir together
9. When the veggies are almost done, add the remaining spices (1/2 teaspoon cumin, 1/2 teaspoon chili powder, 1/2 teaspoon paprika, and 1/2 teaspoon oregano)
10. Add the turkey back into the veggies along with your 1/2 cup of cooked brown rice
11. Add your lime juice and stir everything together. Season to taste
12. Add your cheese – you can either stir it in or sprinkle it on top and melt under the broiler or in the microwave
