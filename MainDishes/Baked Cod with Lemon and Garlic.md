preheat oven to 400 degrees

1. In one shallow bowl prepare the lemon sauce by mixing together 5 tbsp fresh lemon juice, 5 tbsp extra virgin olive oil, and 2 tbsp melted butter.

2. In another shallow bowl, mix together ⅓ cup all-purpose flour with 1 tsp ground coriander, ¾ tsp sweet Spanish paprika, ¾ tsp ground cumin, and ¾ tsp kosher salt.

3. Dip the fish in the lemon sauce, then coat it well with the flour mixture. Keep the lemon sauce for later use. 

4. Sear the fish. To give the cod some good color and texture, sear it in olive oil for about 2 minutes on each side.

5. Add the lemon sauce. Now, to the lemon sauce, add 5 minced garlic cloves (so much flavor), then pour it over the cod.
