## INGREDIENTS
  - 1 turkey
  - 2 zucchini
  - 12 oz speghetti
  - 2 tbsp Tuscan heat spice
  - 2 tsp garlic powder
  - 10 oz marinara
  - chicken stock
  - 4 tbsp cream cheese
  - 4 tbsp sour cream
  - 1/2 cup Parmesan Cheese



## INSTRUCTIONS
   - Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. (TIP: Cover pot with lid to bring water to a boil more quickly.) Wash and dry produce. • Trim zucchini; grate on the largest holes of a box grater.
   - Once water is boiling, add spaghetti to pot. Cook, stirring occasionally, until al dente, 9-11 minutes. 
   - Reserve ¾ cup pasta cooking water (1 cup for 4 servings), then drain.
   Heat a drizzle of oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add turkey*, Tuscan Heat Spice, garlic powder, ½ tsp salt (1 tsp for 4 servings), and pepper. Cook, breaking up meat into pieces, until lightly browned, 2-4 minutes. 
   - Add zucchini; cook, stirring, until zucchini is tender and turkey is cooked through, 2-3 minutes more. 
   - Stir in marinara sauce, stock concentrate, and ¼ cup pasta cooking water (½ cup for 4). Simmer until slightly thickened, 1-2 minutes. 
   - Reduce heat to medium low. Stir in cream cheese, sour cream, half the Parmesan, and 1 TBSP butter (2 TBSP for 4) until melted and combined. Season with salt and pepper.
   - Add pasta to pan with sauce; toss to coat. TIP: If needed, stir in more reserved pasta water a splash at a time until pasta is thoroughly coated in sauce. 
   - Divide between plates; sprinkle with remaining Parmesan and serve.
