## RECIPE

oven to 375

1. Preheat oven to 375.
2. Season the chicken with 1 teaspoon of the salt and ½ teaspoon of the black pepper.
3. Heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a large skillet over medium, high heat. Add in chicken, skin side down, and cook, undisturbed until browned about 5-7 minutes. Turn chicken and repeat on other side for about 5 minutes. Remove chicken from pan and set aside.
4. In the same pan add in remaining olive oil and reduce heat to medium/low. Add onions and cover for 15 minutes. Remove the lid and continue to cook the onions, stirring often, until a nice golden brown color is achieved. The caramelization process should take about 25 minutes, don’t rush it.
5. Once the onions are caramel in color add butter, nutmeg, thyme, bay leaf, garlic, and remaining salt and pepper. Stir and cook for 3 more minutes.
6. Increase heat to high and add wine. Bring to a boil and cook until reduced by half, about 3-5 minutes.
7. Add beef stock, bring to a simmer and cook for an additional 10 minutes.
8. Remove thyme and bay leaf and add chicken back into the onions. Bake uncovered on center rack of preheated oven for 15 minutes.
9. Sprinkle chicken with cheese and place back in the oven under the broiler. Watch carefully so your cheese doesn’t burn.
